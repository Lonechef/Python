# Object types or Data Types
# Numbers : 
# String : EIther singl or double quote all will work in Python
# List in Python
myList = [1,2]
print(myList)
advList = [1,2,['three'],4.5]
print(advList)
# In python similar to list we have the tuple  they are defined by parentheisis ()

myTuple = (1,2,'span'),tuple('spam')
print(myTuple) #So output will be (1,2,'span'),('s','p','a','m'))

# Dictionaties : They are mnetioned in the curly Braces

Dictionary = {'food':'spam',"taste":"yum"}
print(Dictionary)

# Set : No  duplicates 

Set =  set('abc'),{'a','b','c'}
print(Set) #So here the Out put will be  ({'a','b','c'},{'a','c','b'})

# Some calculations using Python is very easy
print(2**100) # This basically means as 2^100
# So doing below will allow us to make any random value
import random
print(random.random())
# YOu can use a method called as random choice
print(random.choice([1,2,3,4,5])) 

username = "Saumya"
print(len(username))
# In python String is treated similarly as list
username = "chaiaurcode"
# SO this is basically treating 2 as out index
print(username[2]) 
# Now basically in this id we give the negative index in this Cse basically
print(username[-1]) #So in this case the counting will start from behind


# SLicing
print(username[1:3]) #So output will be ha basically 1 and 2 

# We have a dir methiod
dir(username)

# In Python LIst is equal to array
myList = [1,2,4];
print(myList)
